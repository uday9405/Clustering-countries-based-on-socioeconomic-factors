# Clustering-countries-based-on-socioeconomic-factors

## Analysis Approach

• The dataset provided has information about 167 countries regarding their
socio economic and health factors viz., ‘child mortatlity rate’, ‘Gross
Domestic Product per Person’, ‘Income’, ’Imports’, ‘Exports’, ‘Health’,
‘Inflation’, ‘Life Expectancy’ etc.

• Performed data cleaning and preparation tasks such as null values, missing
values, outlier analysis etc.

• Outlier treatment is not done though there are outliers in the data as we
don’t want to skew the facts and thereby impacting the analysis.

• Performed PCA and selected as many Principal Components as required to
explain the variance in the data.

•Performed clustering on the PCs obtained using kmeans and hierarchical
clustering to find out the under developed cluster of countries.
